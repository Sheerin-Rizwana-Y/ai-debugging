# 🧠 AI Debugging Toolkit

A modular, backend-first debugging assistant powered by FastAPI and Python ML workflows. This toolkit is designed to help developers trace, analyze, and resolve runtime issues using intelligent suggestions and structured logs.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Trace Analyzer**: Parses stack traces and error logs to identify root causes.
- 🧠 **ML-Powered Suggestions**: Uses trained models to recommend fixes based on historical error patterns.
- 📦 **Modular Architecture**: Clean folder structure for scalable backend development.
- 📄 **Log Ingestion Engine**: Accepts structured/unstructured logs via API and preprocesses them for analysis.
- 🧪 **Test Harness**: Validate endpoints with sample logs and trace inputs.
